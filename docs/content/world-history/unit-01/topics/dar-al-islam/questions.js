      difficulty: "Core",
      skillTag: "Continuity and change",
      prompt: "Which statement best describes Dar al-Islam around 1200–1450?",
      choices: [
        "Political authority divided among regional states, and each developed isolated religious law and scholarly networks.",
        "Muslim political authority divided among states while religious and cultural links persisted.",
        "The Abbasid caliph continued appointing most regional rulers, although sultans commanded local armies and taxes.",
        "New Turkic states restored political unity by replacing Arabic and Persian traditions with one shared government.",
      ],
      correctAnswer: 1,
      explanation:
        "New states held political power, yet religious practices, legal traditions, commerce, and learning connected communities across their borders. Political fragmentation did not mean cultural isolation or continued direct Abbasid control.",

      stimulus:
        "A military ruler commands an army and controls taxation while recognizing the religious prestige of a caliph in Baghdad.",

      choices: [
        "The caliph retained control of taxation while granting the sultan only ceremonial religious authority",
        "Merchant elites replaced military rulers and caliphs as the main source of political legitimacy",
        "Regional military rulers gained authority by abolishing the caliphate and rejecting all Abbasid institutions",
        "A distinction between a sultan’s political power and a caliph’s religious prestige",
      ],
      correctAnswer: 3,
      explanation:
        "Seljuk rulers illustrate how sultans could hold practical military and political authority while Abbasid caliphs retained religious prestige. The tempting reverse arrangement assigns each figure the wrong kind of authority.",

        "It chiefly allowed rulers to negotiate alliances among independent Muslim states.",
        "It imposed one legal interpretation on every Muslim region.",
        "It strengthened regional sultans by letting each supervise a separate pilgrimage.",
      ],
      correctAnswer: 0,
      explanation:
        "Pilgrimage joined a shared religious obligation with travel and encounters across regions. Its unifying effect came from participation in the same practice, not political negotiations, one universal legal interpretation, or separate regional pilgrimages.",

      stimulus:
        "Records from a Muslim-ruled city show Jewish and Christian communities maintaining worship and participating in trade, while facing special taxes and legal restrictions.",

      choices: [
        "Religious minorities gained legal equality because their commercial activity made special taxes unnecessary.",
        "Economic cooperation occurred only after Jewish and Christian residents abandoned public worship.",
        "Religious coexistence could operate alongside unequal legal status.",
        "Non-Muslims maintained worship but were excluded from the city’s commercial life by legal restrictions.",
      ],
      correctAnswer: 2,
      explanation:
        "The evidence includes continuing worship and trade as well as taxes and legal restrictions. A complete conclusion must recognize both coexistence and inequality instead of using one part of the evidence to erase the other.",

      stimulus:

        "Commercial contact that prepared the port for conversion after its conquest by an Abbasid army",
        "Religious diffusion through commerce and teaching",
        "State-sponsored conversion led by a local ruler seeking closer relations with Muslim merchants",
        "Migration by Muslim merchants that replaced the port’s existing population and religious traditions",
      ],
      correctAnswer: 1,
      explanation:
        "The scenario gives evidence of trade and Sufi teaching but explicitly excludes military conquest. Contact could support gradual religious diffusion without state sponsorship or the replacement of the local population.",

      id: "islam-q6",
      concept: "islam-spread",
      difficulty: "Apply",
      skillTag: "Historical reasoning",
      prompt:
        "Why should a historian distinguish the expansion of Muslim rule from the spread of Islam?",
      choices: [
        "The expansion of Muslim rule describes religious conversion, whereas the spread of Islam describes changing state borders.",
        "Military conquest created Islamic states, while merchants affected commerce without influencing religious belief.",
        "Islam could spread through trade beyond state borders, but Muslim rulers governed only communities that had already converted.",
        "A Muslim government could rule non-Muslims, and Islam could spread beyond its political borders.",
      ],
      correctAnswer: 3,
      explanation:
        "Political control and religious change are different processes. Muslim states could rule non-Muslim subjects, while merchants and teachers could carry Islam beyond those states; neither process required the other to be complete.",

        "Merchants carrying Indian mathematical texts to new scholarly markets across Dar al-Islam",
      ],
      correctAnswer: 0,
      explanation:
        "Al-Tusi’s mathematical and astronomical work added to knowledge. Copying, translating, and transporting texts are important forms of preservation or transfer, but innovation specifically develops new methods, explanations, or findings.",

      stimulus:
        "A student claims that the Mongol capture of Baghdad in 1258 ended intellectual activity everywhere in the Islamic world.",
      prompt: "Which evidence most directly challenges the claim?",

        "Abbasid caliphs had supported translation and scholarship in Baghdad before the Mongol conquest.",
        "Ibn Rushd produced philosophical commentaries in al-Andalus during the twelfth century.",
        "Al-Tusi conducted astronomical work under Mongol patronage, and Ibn Khaldun wrote in a later century.",
        "Baghdad’s libraries contained works produced in earlier centuries.",
      ],
      correctAnswer: 2,
      explanation:
        "The claim concerns all intellectual activity after 1258, so evidence of later scholarship directly contradicts it. The other choices establish earlier achievements but do not prove that new intellectual work continued afterward.",

      id: "islam-q9",
      concept: "islam-exchange",
      difficulty: "Apply",
      skillTag: "Explaining a process",
      prompt:
        "Which sequence best explains one route of intellectual exchange through Iberia?",
      choices: [
        "Greek texts → translation from Latin into Arabic in Iberia → replacement of Arabic scholarship by European universities",
        "Arabic texts and commentaries → direct adoption by European scholars without translation → identical interpretations",
        "European texts → translation into Arabic → use limited to Muslim rulers and excluded from Iberian scholarly communities",
        "Arabic texts and commentaries → translation into Latin → wider use by European scholars",
      ],
      correctAnswer: 3,
      explanation:
        "Translation from Arabic into Latin allowed additional European readers to study earlier works and Arabic commentaries. Exchange widened access and debate rather than eliminating translation, producing identical interpretations, or restricting texts to rulers.",

        "Both involved receiving societies adopting and adapting ideas across political boundaries.",
        "Both crossed borders, but receiving societies copied foreign ideas without local adaptation.",
        "Both required conquest and political control before cultural exchange could occur.",
        "Both remained limited to rulers and scholars and did not reshape local traditions.",
      ],
      correctAnswer: 0,
      explanation:
        "In both cases, cultural influence crossed political borders and involved local choices. The key distinction is that receiving societies adapted ideas; exchange did not require conquest, exact copying, or direct imperial rule.",

      ],
      correctAnswer: 2,

      skillTag: "Explaining significance",
      prompt: "Why did translating scholarly works into new languages matter?",
      choices: [
        "It removed the need for anyone to study earlier ideas.",
        "It proved all societies held identical beliefs.",
        "It ensured every translated idea remained unchanged forever.",
        "It allowed new groups of readers to study, debate, and develop the ideas.",
      ],
      correctAnswer: 3,
      explanation:
        "Translation widened access to knowledge. Readers could interpret or build on ideas, so intellectual transfer could also support further innovation.",
