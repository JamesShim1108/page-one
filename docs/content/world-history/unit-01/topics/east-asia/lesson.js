  summary:
    "Song China: an enduring government, changing economy, and influential culture.",
  courseId: "world",
  order: 1,
  minutes: 10,
  learningGoals: [
    "Explain continuity in Chinese government and the limits of examination-based mobility.",
    "Connect belief systems and cultural exchange to East Asian societies.",
    "Explain how agricultural, manufacturing, and transport innovations supported commercialization.",
  ],
  bigIdea:
    "Song China combined long-standing ideas about authority with changes in farming and trade. Its neighbors borrowed Chinese practices while shaping societies of their own.",
  context:
    "Around 1200, the Southern Song governed much of southern China. The Song dynasty lasted from 960 to 1279; the broader topic continues through Mongol Yuan rule and into the Ming period. Use Song China as a starting point, not as the ruler of this entire timeline.",

          type: "paragraph",
          text: "An emperor could not personally collect every tax or settle every local dispute. An imperial bureaucracy, a network of appointed officials, carried out those jobs. The Song expanded this system, building on institutions developed under earlier dynasties.",
        },
        {
          type: "paragraph",
          text: "Civil service examinations tested knowledge of Confucian writings and helped select officials. Success could give an educated man a path into government beyond inherited noble rank. But preparation required time, teachers, and books, giving wealthy families a major advantage. Women were excluded from the examination route.",
        },
        {
          type: "paragraph",
          text: "The scholar-gentry gained influence through education, government service, and often landownership. The important connection: exams tied political opportunity to a shared set of ideas, while unequal access to education preserved social hierarchy.",
        },
      ],
      takeaway:
        "An exam-based system offered some social mobility. It did not give everyone an equal opportunity or make imperial China a democracy.",

        {
          type: "paragraph",
          text: "Confucian teaching emphasized ethical conduct and duties within relationships: rulers and subjects, parents and children, elders and younger people. Filial piety meant respect and responsibility toward parents and ancestors. These family expectations helped make a wider hierarchy seem legitimate.",
        },
        {
          type: "paragraph",
          text: "Neo-Confucian thinkers renewed Confucian traditions while responding to ideas associated with Buddhism and Daoism. They put moral self-cultivation at the center of an account of how society and the universe should work. This was a changing intellectual tradition, not simply a return to an untouched past.",
        },
        {
          type: "paragraph",
          text: "Buddhism, which originated in South Asia, remained influential across East Asia. Its teachings connected suffering with craving and offered ethical and spiritual paths toward liberation. Communities developed different traditions; Chan in China and Zen in Japan emphasized meditation. Confucianism, Buddhism, and Daoism could coexist and influence one another.",
        },
        {
          type: "paragraph",
          text: "Buddhist branches shared important teachings but developed different institutions and practices. Theravada traditions became prominent in Sri Lanka and much of mainland Southeast Asia, with a strong monastic tradition. Mahayana traditions, influential in China and Korea, emphasized the bodhisattva ideal of helping other beings toward liberation. Tibetan Buddhism drew on Mahayana and Vajrayana practices, including ritual and teacher lineages. These broad labels contain considerable diversity.",
        },
        {
          type: "paragraph",
          text: "Social roles remained unequal. Patriarchal expectations privileged male authority, and foot binding among some Chinese families restricted women’s mobility and reflected status distinctions. Cultural ideals should be understood as historical beliefs, not universal rules for how people should live.",
        },
      ],
      takeaway:
        "Continuity and change can happen together: familiar social duties persisted as thinkers developed new interpretations.",

      blocks: [
        {
          type: "paragraph",
          text: "Early-ripening Champa rice reached China from a kingdom in present-day Vietnam. Alongside irrigation, improved tools, and other farming changes, it helped raise food output. In suitable conditions, a shorter growing season allowed more than one harvest a year.",
        },
        {
          type: "paragraph",
          text: "A larger food supply supported population growth and more people working outside farming. Farmers and artisans increasingly produced for markets. Workshops supplied goods such as silk, porcelain, and iron products, while cities brought buyers, sellers, and craftspeople together.",
        },
        {
          type: "paragraph",
          text: "Waterways, including the Grand Canal, linked producing regions and markets. Better shipping and navigation supported trade; paper money helped some transactions. Growing trade did not mean farming disappeared: peasants and artisans still did much of the work that sustained the economy.",
        },
        {
          type: "paragraph",
          text: "Manufacturing and technical knowledge reinforced these changes. Iron and steel production supplied tools and other goods; printing made texts more available to readers; and the compass supported navigation. Porcelain and textiles reached distant buyers. This growth relied heavily on peasant and artisanal labor and should not be confused with the later factory-based Industrial Revolution.",
        },
      ],
      takeaway:
        "Explain the chain: greater farm output → support for population and specialized work → expanding markets. Rice was one contributor, not the sole cause.",

          type: "paragraph",
          text: "Chinese writing, Confucian learning, and Buddhist traditions spread through contact with Korea, Japan, and Vietnam. Trade, scholars, monks, and diplomacy carried ideas across borders. Adoption depended on local priorities and existing institutions.",
        },
        {
          type: "paragraph",
          text: "Korea and Vietnam used versions of Chinese-style examinations and Confucian administration, but local elites and traditions shaped how these worked. In Japan, Chinese cultural influences coexisted with Shinto traditions and growing warrior authority under shoguns.",
        },
        {
          type: "paragraph",
          text: "For a useful comparison, name something shared and something different. Song China and Japan both drew on Buddhist and Chinese cultural traditions, but appointed scholar-officials were central to Song government while warrior elites held major political power in medieval Japan.",
        },
        {
          type: "paragraph",
          text: "Heian Japan had earlier adapted Chinese writing, court institutions, and Buddhist learning while developing a distinctive literary culture. By around 1200, military governments and warrior elites were increasingly important. In Korea and Vietnam, local elites similarly shaped borrowed institutions. Diplomatic tribute and cultural influence should not be assumed to mean direct Chinese rule.",
        },
      ],
      takeaway:
        "Cultural influence does not, by itself, prove political control. Look for adaptation as well as similarity.",
